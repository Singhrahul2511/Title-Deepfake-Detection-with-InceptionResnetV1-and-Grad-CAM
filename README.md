# Title-Deepfake-Detection-with-InceptionResnetV1-and-Grad-CAM
This repository contains an implementation of a deep learning-based system for detecting and explaining deepfake images
The system utilizes the InceptionResnetV1 architecture pretrained on the VGGFace2 dataset for face classification, along with Grad-CAM (Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping) for providing visual explanations of the model's predictions.
#Here we have also used pytorch for data processing ,model building and model evaluation.
